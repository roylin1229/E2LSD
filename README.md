# E2LSD Algorithm

**Effective and Efficient Line Segment Detection for Visual Measurement Guided by Level Lines**

## Getting Started

To run the example, follow these steps:

1. Install [mexopencv](https://kyamagu.github.io/mexopencv/) to obtain the "GaussianBlur" function.
2. Run the "E2LSD_demo.m" script.
